# DCGAN-MNIST
This repository contains a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) trained on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digits. The model uses convolutional and transposed convolutional layers to generate high-quality 28Ã—28 grayscale digits from random noise.
